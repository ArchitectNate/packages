# Docs

We need internally and externally a good gitbook like way to make docs from Markdown and SVG.

FLutter is the right way to do this because we can leverage it.

- Can embed into deployed apps as Help
- Can deploy to Web for Developer docs.

Good example for the CI of it to deplyo to Firebase
