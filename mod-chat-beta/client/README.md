# Mod-Chat-Beta

What's done:
- UI for pane and for chat
- Data structure and safe send to hive
- Two-way Read Receipts implementation
- Mark read and unread from message pane

What's not (easiest to hardest):
- Receive from hive and rebuild UI (easy)
- i18n (should be a simple plug)
- RTT (I have no idea how to implement)
